        <h2>Panel 2: Revisiting Curriculum for Law in Graduation level, in the light of Generative AI driven society. </h2>
        <hr>
        Our focus will be on several key areas to be included in Legal curriculum:

        <ol type="1">
            <b><li>Understanding Generative AI Technologies</li></b>
                <p>Lawyers must possess a foundational understanding of AI technologies, particularly how generative models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 work. This includes an appreciation of their capabilities, limitations, and the ethical considerations surrounding their use. This knowledge is vital, not just for practical application, but for guiding legal decisions in a landscape where AI-generated content is prevalent.</p>
            <b><li>Legal Implications of AI-Generated Content</li></b>
            <p>The proliferation of AI in generating realistic text, images, and videos raises complex legal issues, including intellectual property rights, authenticity and verification challenges, and the potential for misuse in misinformation and deepfakes. Future legal curriculums must equip lawyers to address these challenges effectively.</p>


            <b><li>Ethical and Privacy Considerations</li></b>
            <p>As AI technologies become more integrated into society, lawyers will increasingly confront ethical dilemmas and privacy concerns. Understanding the balance between technological innovation and ethical responsibility will be crucial.    </p>
            <b><li>Adaptation of Traditional Legal Skills</li></b>

            <p>While AI brings new dimensions to legal practice, traditional legal skills remain foundational. Future lawyers must learn to integrate these skills with AI tools, enhancing their ability to analyze, interpret, and strategize in a technologically advanced legal environment.</p>
            <b><li>Emerging Legal Fields</li></b>
            <p>We must also anticipate the emergence of new legal fields and specializations focused on AI and its applications. This foresight can help in molding a curriculum that is both contemporary and forward-looking.</p>
        </ol> 

        <p>As we embark on this discussion, let us remember that our goal is not just to adapt to change but to lead the way in shaping a legal education system that is robust, dynamic, and equipped for the future. The journey we begin today is not just about reimagining education; it's about redefining our role in a society where the lines between human and machine-generated content are increasingly blurred.
